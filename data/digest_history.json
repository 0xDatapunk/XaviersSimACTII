From the initial culture shock of college life at NYU to embracing the chaotic energy of the city, his path has been marked by both personal and technological evolution. His early days were filled with the typical freshman struggles - adapting to independence, managing coursework, and forming new friendships. However, Xavier quickly found himself drawn to the evolving tech scene, particularly the realms of blockchain, Web3, and trading. His involvement with $XVI, a cryptocurrency that serendipitously bore his initials, became a defining aspect of his identity, blending his personal life with his technological interests.\n\nAfter a whirlwind of college life, internships, and side projects, Xavier's journey took a dramatic turn with a spontaneous trip to Bangkok. This trip wasn't just an escape; it was a pivotal moment of reflection. The vibrant culture, the historical temples, and the bustling markets provided a stark contrast to his life in NYC, offering him a new perspective on technology, life, and his own aspirations. His engagement with mature technologies like blockchain and trading apps had shaped his daily routine, but now, emerging technologies like digital consciousness and sustainable space exploration captured his imagination, pushing him towards a deeper philosophical inquiry.\n\nReturning from Bangkok, Xavier found himself at a crossroads. His involvement with $XVI had grown, not just in value but in its implications for his future. His life now reflects a balance between leveraging technology for personal gain and exploring its broader implications on humanity. This journey has been one of learning, adapting, and occasionally taking leaps of faith, like considering dropping out of college to dive into the world of quant trading or exploring psychedelic experiences to expand his consciousness.",
