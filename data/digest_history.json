      "Story": "Xavier's journey through his early twenties has been a whirlwind of exploration, self-discovery, and unexpected turns. Starting at NYU, he was thrust into the bustling life of New York City, grappling with college life's initial disorientation and the dichotomy between academic expectations and real-world experiences. His fascination with technology led him to delve into blockchain, Web3, and trading, reflecting a young mind eager to innovate and disrupt. His personal life saw him navigating friendships, dating, and the quest for identity in a fast-paced environment, often feeling out of sync with the seemingly put-together world around him. The discovery of $XVI, a cryptocurrency bearing his initials, became a surreal subplot, blending his tech interests with an almost mythical personal narrative. This intrigue, coupled with his academic and social experiences, pushed him towards a pivotal decision to take a leave of absence from college, focusing instead on a career in quant trading. His life has since oscillated between the thrill of market gains and the introspection of personal losses, culminating in a spontaneous trip to Bangkok for a break from the relentless pace of his life.
