Starting at NYU, he grappled with the typical college freshman struggles, from adapting to city life to navigating the complexities of his coursework.

Over time, Xavier's life took a significant turn as he embraced the potential of $XVI, a cryptocurrency that seemed to mirror his own journey of growth and unpredictability. His decision to take a leave of absence from college to pursue a career in quant trading reflects his desire to forge his own path, one less traveled by his peers.
