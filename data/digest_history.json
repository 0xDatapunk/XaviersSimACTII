His initial posts reflect a mix of homesickness, humor, and the raw, unfiltered experience of being a freshman. His interest in technology, particularly in computer science and the burgeoning world of blockchain, began to take shape.\\n\\n- **Sophomore Year (19-20):** As Xavier's confidence grew, so did his engagement with technology. He started exploring cryptocurrencies, trading, and the implications of blockchain technology. His posts began to show a deeper curiosity about how these technologies could shape society, mixed with personal anecdotes about his life, like the excitement of a first date or the disappointment of a coding project gone awry. His social circle expanded, and he delved deeper into the finance and tech communities.\\n\\n- **Junior Year (20-21):** This period was marked by a significant shift. Xavier's growing involvement in trading, especially with his own cryptocurrency $XVI, led him to question his academic path. He considered leaving college to pursue a career in quant trading, reflecting a practical approach to his future. His posts oscillated between moments of self-doubt, exhilaration from trading successes, and philosophical musings about life's direction.\\n\\n- **Senior Year and Beyond (21-22):** Xavier decided to take a leave of absence from college, embracing the uncertainty of a non-traditional path. His journey took him to Bangkok, where he immersed himself in new cultures, further broadening his perspective on technology's global impact. His reflections started to incorporate themes of purpose, legacy, and the role of technology in human identity. \\n\\n**STORY DIRECTION:**\\n\\nAs Xavier moves forward into his early twenties, several key developments can naturally evolve:\\n\\n- **Professional Journey:** His career in blockchain and Web3 will continue to flourish.
