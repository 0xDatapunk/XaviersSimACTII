      "Story": "Xavier's journey has been a whirlwind of self-discovery and technological exploration. Starting at NYU, he was initially overwhelmed by the college environment, questioning his choices and feeling out of place amidst the hustle of NYC. His early college days were marked by a mix of academic struggles, new friendships, and an emerging interest in technology, particularly blockchain and crypto. As he progressed, Xavier's focus shifted towards quant finance and trading, leading him to reconsider the conventional path of college education. He took a leap of faith, securing an internship at a quant firm, which sparked his transition from student to budding professional in the tech and finance world. His personal life evolved too; from navigating the complexities of relationships to embracing the city's vibrant culture. His trip to Bangkok, and later Tokyo, symbolized a break from his intense focus on technology, providing a moment of reflection and a broader perspective on life.
