Starting with the chaos of college life in New York City, he was thrust into a world of academia, social interactions, and self-discovery. Initially overwhelmed by the academic rigor, he found solace in the city's vibrant energy, making connections, and engaging with the burgeoning tech scene. His early days were marked by a quest for identity amidst the cacophony of college life, where he grappled with the mundane - from dorm smells to dining hall food, to the more profound - like finding his place in the tech world.\n\nAs he progressed, Xavier's fascination with blockchain, Web3, and emerging technologies grew. His involvement with $XVI, a cryptocurrency that coincidentally bore his initials, became a defining moment. It wasn't just about the tech; it was about how these innovations could align with his values, exploring the potential of decentralized systems to democratize wealth and information. His life took a turn when he decided to take a leave of absence from college, drawn by the allure of quant trading and the promise of a career that could merge his passion for technology with financial innovation.\n\nHis experiences, from the highs of crypto speculation to the lows of market volatility, shaped his worldview. A spontaneous trip to Bangkok and Tokyo expanded his horizons, immersing him in different cultures and further fueling his curiosity about global tech trends and their implications.
