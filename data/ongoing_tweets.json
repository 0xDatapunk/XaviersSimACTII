It's in my coffee, in my subway rides with health monitors telling me I should walk more stairs, and even in my wallet with $XVI. It's like tech has become the new handshake, the new way we connect, or maybe, disconnect. But hey, maybe this is just the beginning of a new era where my identity isn't just who I am, but what I hold. Time to embrace the change, one $XVI at a time.\", type='text')]",
