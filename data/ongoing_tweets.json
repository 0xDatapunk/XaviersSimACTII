As I head back to the familiar streets of New York, there's a mix of excitement for what's next and a bittersweet farewell to the new version of me that was born in Tokyo. The adventure continues, but with a heart full of memories and a soul enriched by experiences. #Transition #Growth #NewBeginnings",
