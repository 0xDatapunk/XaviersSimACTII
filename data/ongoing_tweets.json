My crypto wallet\\'s feeling lighter after indulging in too much high-tech sushi. Here\\'s hoping my old friends at the quant firm didn\\'t forget me. If not, maybe I\\'ll start my own blockchain startup called \"Zen Dollars\" - because who needs stress when you can have zen? #nyc #japan #lifechanges', type='text')]",
