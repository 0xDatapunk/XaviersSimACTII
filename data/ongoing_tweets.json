We were brainstorming how to make our app not just a tool, but a catalyst for sustainable living. The idea was to allow users to trade solar energy credits, fostering both tech innovation and environmental responsibility. But, in my excitement, I forgot to check my inbox, and now I'm kicking myself for missing a chance to bring our vision to life. Here's to learning from our tech missteps, I guess. \ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\udca1\ud83d\udd0c\", type='text')]",
