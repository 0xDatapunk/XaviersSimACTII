Here I am, at 22, feeling both a world apart and yet so connected to my roots in NYC through the $XVI token. It's funny how a piece of code can make you feel at home anywhere. I've been thinking a lot about identity lately - how we define ourselves in this digital age. Is it our physical location, our digital footprint, or the values we hold? Tokyo's blend of tradition and tech is making me question all of this. Maybe it's time to redefine what 'home' means to me. #TechReflections\", type='text')]",
