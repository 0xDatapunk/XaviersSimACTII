      "raw_content": "\ud83c\udf0f\u2708\ufe0f Just touched down in NYC after an unforgettable journey through Tokyo and Thailand. The experiences there were a whirlwind of colors, culture, and self-discovery. \ud83c\udf05 The sunrise atop Mount Fuji was a moment of clarity - I'm back, but not quite the same Xavier. \n\nThe spontaneity of booking flights and immersing myself in different worlds has reshaped my perspective on life and technology. I'm now questioning my academic path more than ever, feeling the pull towards a life less ordinary. \ud83c\udf93\ud83d\udcc9 The idea of dropping out to dive into quant trading and tech full-time feels less like a leap into the unknown and more like a step towards my true calling.\n\nEmotionally, I'm a mix of excitement and uncertainty. The adventure has ignited a spark, but now, back in the familiar yet now foreign streets of NYC, I'm at a crossroads. How will I balance this newfound desire for freedom and exploration with the expectations of my academic and family life? \n\n#JourneyEnds #NewBeginnings #LifeChanging #XavierTravels",
