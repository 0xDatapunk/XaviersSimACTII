The contrast between the traditional brush strokes and the dynamic, interactive digital installations was striking. We talked about how tech can enrich cultural experiences, and it sparked an idea for a project that blends blockchain with art. It's fascinating how shared interests in tech can deepen personal connections in unexpected ways. The lesson? Innovation isn't just about creating new tech; it's about using it to connect and understand the world differently.\", type='text')]",
