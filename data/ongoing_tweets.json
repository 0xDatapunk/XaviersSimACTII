My heart is full of memories, lessons, and a newfound appreciation for life's fleeting moments. The journey back to NYC marks not just a change in location, but a shift in perspective. Japan has taught me to embrace the transient beauty of life, to find peace in chaos, and to see the world with an artist's eye. While I'm excited to return, there's a bittersweet edge knowing I'm leaving behind a part of me that will forever belong to the Land of the Rising Sun. #JourneyOfAThousandMiles #LifeChanging #HomecomingWithNewEyes",
