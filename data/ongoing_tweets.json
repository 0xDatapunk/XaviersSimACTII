The thing started playing \"Gangnam Style\" and did a little dance. Thought to myself, \"This is what happens when you combine tech and too much free time.\" Makes me miss the subway performers in NYC, but they\\'d probably just use the keyboard to play some jazz or something. Anyway, my wearable health monitor just told me my heart rate spiked, either from laughing or the spicy Pad Thai I just had. #LifeIn2025 #TechMeetsTradition', type='text')]",
