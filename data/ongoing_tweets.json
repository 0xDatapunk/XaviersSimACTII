The journey has been more than just travel; it's reshaped my perspective on life and technology. I've seen the fusion of tradition and innovation firsthand, and now, I'm questioning what truly makes me happy. The uncertainty of the future excites me as much as it scares me. Time to pivot, maybe back into the crypto world or perhaps something entirely new. The city's energy calls, and I'm ready to answer with a fresh mindset. #LifeTransition #BackToTheBigApple",
