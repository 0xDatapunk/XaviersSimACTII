You'd think they're launching rockets, not flushing waste. But hey, if this is the future, I'm here for it. Feels like stepping into a sci-fi movie, except instead of battling aliens, I'm battling jet lag with a side of existential dread. Tokyo's a far cry from the chaos of NYC, yet somehow, it feels like the same kind of energy, just with less honking and more politeness. Gotta admit, the blend of tradition and tech here is making me rethink my life choices. Maybe I should've majored in toilet engineering? The future's looking flush with possibilities.\", type='text')]",
