This trip wasn't just about adventure; it was a catalyst for reflection and change. \n\nI've decided to officially take a leave of absence from college to dive headfirst into quant trading and blockchain technology. The vibrant markets of Bangkok, the serene beauty of Japan, they've all shown me that life's too short to not follow your passion. \n\nEmotionally, there's a whirlwind of excitement, fear, and a newfound clarity. Practically, it means diving into a world I've only theorized about, facing financial uncertainties head-on, and potentially reshaping my future. \n\nHere's to embracing the unknown, to living life on my terms, and to creating a future where my interests in technology and finance intersect. #LifeChangingDecisions #EmbraceTheJourney #QuantTrading #BlockchainFuture",
