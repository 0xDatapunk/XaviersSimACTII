Walked past my favorite pizza joint in Alphabet City, and you know what? The smell of garlic and tomato sauce is like a blockchain for my memories - immutable and always the same. Got me thinking, in this city where everything moves at the speed of light, there's something comforting about the constants. Even my old wearable health monitor is buzzing less now, must be the calm I absorbed in Tokyo. Now, if only my crypto wallet would start buzzing again... Maybe I'll pitch 'Zen Dollars' to some old Wall Street friends over a slice. Who knows, might just be the next big thing in financial wellness.\", type='text')]",
