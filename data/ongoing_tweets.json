I got a little too thrilled trying to haggle for a vintage camera. My secure digital ID came in handy though, scored a discount for being 'securely' honest about my age. Now, sitting in a quaint cafe, I'm sipping on a Thai iced tea, reflecting on how every place I visit adds a new brush stroke to my life's canvas. The art gallery really did reignite my passion for sketching, but now I'm wondering, what's my next masterpiece? Maybe a comic strip about a guy who travels the world with a too-honest health monitor? #LifeAsArt\", type='text')]",
