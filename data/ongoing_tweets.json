But here's the kicker: I'm wearing my new Japanese smartwatch that tracks my stress levels, and guess what? It spiked when I saw a $50 charge for a slice of pizza. Apparently, my body thinks inflation is a personal affront. At least my health monitor's syncing with my blockchain ID for seamless payments. Gotta love tech, even if it tells on my overpriced cravings. #JustNYCThings\", type='text')]",
