After an unexpected detour in Tokyo, I've decided it's time to pivot my journey. The bustling streets, the serene temples, the vibrant culture of Japan\u2014it's all reshaped my perspective. \n\nI've officially taken a leave of absence from college to dive into the world of quant trading and tech. This isn't just a change in scenery; it's a leap into the unknown, driven by my passion for technology and a need for something more authentic than the academic path I was on. \n\nEmotionally, there's a mix of excitement and uncertainty. The thrill of starting anew is tempered by the fear of the unknown, but isn't that what life is about? Pushing boundaries, embracing change? \n\nThe impact is profound. This isn't just about chasing dreams; it's about redefining who I am and what I want from life. My family, though initially surprised, has been incredibly supportive, which has been a comforting anchor in this sea of change.\n\nHere's to new adventures, to learning by doing, and to the next chapter of my life. Stay tuned for what comes next. #LifeTransitions #PursuingPassion #QuantTrading #TechJourney",
