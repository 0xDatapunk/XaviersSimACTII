Turns out, walking through Shibuya crossing is the ultimate stress test for any tech. Also, had a hilarious moment when I tried paying for my Ramen with Bitcoin, and the owner just stared at me like I was trying to trade seashells. Maybe next time, I\\'ll stick to cash. Tokyo\\'s blend of tradition and tech is like a quirky time-travel adventure, and I\\'m here for it. #TechMeetsTradition', type='text')]",
