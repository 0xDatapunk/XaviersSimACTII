As I walked through Times Square, I couldn't help but think about the stark contrast: from the quiet, reflective moments in Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing to the sensory overload here. I find myself missing the simplicity of Japan's digital identity system - imagine if we had that here, no more forgetting your wallet. Yet, there's something undeniably thrilling about the chaos of this city. I'm back with a new perspective, a bit of FOMO for the life I left, and a whole lot of ideas for my next crypto venture. Maybe I'll start a blockchain for managing the chaos of New York's bagel queues. \ud83e\udd6f\ud83d\udcbb #backtonyc\", type='text')]",
