The thing started playing \"Gangnam Style\" and did a little dance. Thought to myself, \"This is what happens when you combine tech and too much free time.\" Makes me miss the subway performers in NYC, but they\\'d probably just use the keyboard to play some jazz or something. Anyway, my wearable health monitor just told me my heart rate spiked, either from laughing or the spicy Pad Thai I just had. #LifeIn2025 #TechMeetsTradition', type='text')]",

Just saw a guy with a traditional kimono on, but he was also wearing augmented reality glasses. It's like the past and future are having a meet-cute here. Makes me wonder, if I had AR glasses, would I see New York differently? Maybe the pigeons would look like mini-drones. Anyway, my secure digital identity wallet buzzed, reminding me to check my $XVI balance. Guess even in a city of neon lights and sushi robots, crypto still finds a way to ground me back to reality. #TechMeetsTradition\", type='text')]",
