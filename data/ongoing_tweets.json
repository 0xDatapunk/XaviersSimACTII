The journey has been more than just a break; it's reshaped my perspective on life, technology, and my own aspirations. The vibrant chaos of Bangkok, the serene beauty of Japan, they've all shown me the world's vastness and my own potential within it. Now, back in the concrete jungle, I'm filled with both excitement and uncertainty. The time away made me realize how much I've changed, and how much I want to pivot my life towards trading and tech. This trip might be over, but the journey of self-discovery and career transformation is just beginning. #LifeChange #TechJourney #NewBeginnings",
