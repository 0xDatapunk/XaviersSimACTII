The vibrant streets of Tokyo, the serene landscapes, and the rich culture have left an indelible mark on me. As I step back into the familiar, yet now somehow different, I carry with me a piece of Japan. This journey has not only broadened my horizons but also stirred a deep introspection about my path ahead. Excited, yet uncertain, about what's next. #LifeInTransition #JapanToNYC",
