Gotta make sure my digital wealth is intact before I dive into the sensory overload that is Japan. As I walked through the bustling streets, I realized how different life feels here compared to NYC. Back home, everyone's always on their phones, but here, it's like the city itself is a smartphone\u2014every corner has something new to discover, every alley a new app to download. It's like living in a tech utopia, and I'm here for it. But even amidst all this, I keep thinking about how my identity is becoming more digital. My $XVI isn't just a number on a screen; it's a piece of who I am, a testament to my belief in a future where technology isn't just a tool, but a part of us. Makes you wonder, what's next for us humans? Will we even need physical wallets soon?\\n```\", type='text')]",
