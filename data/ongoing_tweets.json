Just saw a street performer using a blockchain-based digital hat for tips. You drop your digital identity in, and if you like the show, a secure transaction happens. Makes me think about the old $XVI days - when a hat was just a hat, and tips were in cash. Life's gotten so digital, even my nostalgic moments feel like they're from a bygone era. But hey, at least my wearable health monitor tells me my heart rate's still normal when I'm reminiscing. #NYC #TechTales #Nostalgia\", type='text')]",
