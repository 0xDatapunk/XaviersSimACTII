The city's energy is the same, but I've got this new layer of calm from my travels. Now, I'm just standing here, wondering if my fridge still knows how to keep my seltzer cold or if it needs a blockchain update. Time to see if my New York survival skills are still intact. #BackToTheSim\", type='text')]",
