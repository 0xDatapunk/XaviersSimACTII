After visiting a digital art museum, I got to thinking about $XVI and how it's more than just a number. It's like the art I saw - intangible but real. It's crazy to think my life's savings are tied to something you can't touch, but isn't that life now? Everything's digital, even our identities. Kinda makes me nostalgic for the days when cash was king, but I'm embracing this new world. #DigitalNomad\", type='text')]",
