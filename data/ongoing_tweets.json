Japan was like a dream, right? \ud83c\udf75 The tea ceremonies taught me patience, Tokyo's streets were sensory overload in the best way, and Kyoto's temples? Pure peace. \n\nRemember those first days when every word was a struggle? Now, I can hold a convo without making everyone cringe. And that sushi in Tsukiji? Mind-blowing. Better than any high-end place back home. The kindness of strangers, too, was something else. They helped me out so much, made me feel like I belonged.\n\n### Feelings About Returning to NYC \ud83d\uddfd\n\nSlipping back into NYC feels like putting on an old jacket. Comforting, but it's a bit snug now. Excited to be back, sure, but there's this part of me that's like, \"Do I really want to dive back into that chaos?\" The skyline's a sight for sore eyes, but I'm gonna miss the calm of Japan.\n\nHow do I even start to blend these worlds? Will I crave those early trains or the sound of the shamisen at festivals? Can I keep up with calligraphy here?\n\n### Personal Growth During Travel \ud83c\udf31\n\nJapan was my canvas, and I painted it with lessons in humility, resilience, and just going with the flow. Learned to live with less, find joy in the mundane, and see beauty in the broken. Kintsugi, right? My life's a bit like that now\u2014flaws and all, but more beautiful for it.\n\nI've grown so much. Navigated foreign lands, made friends, found peace in crowds. This journey peeled back layers of who I am. The Xavier who left isn't the one coming back; I'm more thoughtful, more in tune with the moment.\n\n### The Return Journey \u2708\ufe0f\n\nThis flight back is like a bridge between two worlds. Looking out at the Pacific, I'm nostalgic for Japan, but there's this excitement about sharing my stories, hosting sushi nights, and bringing some calm into the NYC madness. \n\nAs we descend towards JFK, I'm smiling, ready to merge these worlds into one enriched life. Here goes nothing, or everything. \ud83c\udf1f",
