His life then becomes a whirlwind of high stakes, from an underground poker game where he wins big, to networking with crypto enthusiasts at a day party. His social life reflects the highs and lows of NYC's nightlife and moments of introspection.\\n\\nA significant emotional turning point occurs when Xavier loses his job, leading him to reassess his life's direction.
