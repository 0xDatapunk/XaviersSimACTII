His social life mirrors the highs and lows of NYC's nightlife, interspersed with moments of introspection.\\n\\nA pivotal moment comes when Xavier loses his job, leading him to a period of deep self-assessment. This triggers a spontaneous trip to Bangkok, where he seeks clarity and inspiration through cultural immersion. His journey continues to Tokyo, where the chaos and beauty of Shibuya's scramble crossing expand his worldview.\\n\\nReturning to New York at 22, Xavier feels a comforting embrace from the familiar skyline, yet he brings back a transformed perspective. His time abroad has not only broadened his cultural horizons but also fueled his ambitions in blockchain technology, inspired by Tokyo's tech scene.
