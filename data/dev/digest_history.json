      "Story": "Xavier's journey from age 18 to 22 has been a whirlwind of personal growth, career exploration, and technological discovery. From the initial shock of college life in NYC, with its quirky encounters and the struggle to find his place, Xavier's path took an unexpected turn as he delved into the world of finance and trading. His interest in cryptocurrency, particularly $XVI, which eerily bears his initials, has intertwined with his personal narrative, making him question the boundaries between his life and digital trends. Professionally, he's transitioned from a college student to a budding quant trader, mastering Rust for high-frequency trading and developing proprietary strategies. His personal life has been a mix of urban exploration, forming new connections, and navigating the complexities of young adulthood, including a spontaneous trip to Bangkok, which was both a physical and metaphorical journey into new experiences and self-reflection.",
