      "Story": "Xavier, now in his early career phase, has navigated through his first years of college with a mix of excitement, confusion, and growth. He's started to find his footing in quantitative trading and AI, learning the ropes of blockchain and DeFi. His journey has been marked by early successes, like securing an internship in a quant firm, and personal exploration, including his first forays into serious dating. However, the last year brought unexpected challenges, from market volatility affecting his investments to personal doubts about his educational path. Recently, Xavier took a leave of absence from NYU to pursue a full-time opportunity in quant trading, a decision influenced by his growing interest in $XVI and the broader crypto market. He's now in the process of adapting to this new chapter, balancing professional aspirations with personal growth.",
