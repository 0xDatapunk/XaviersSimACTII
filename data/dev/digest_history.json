      "Story": "Xavier's journey from 18 to 22 has been a whirlwind of academic challenges, personal growth, and unexpected turns into the world of finance and technology. Starting with the typical college experience, he quickly found himself diving deep into trading, cryptocurrencies, and personal development. His initial struggles with college life gave way to a newfound passion for quant trading and market analysis. This shift was marked by his engagement with high-frequency trading, developing trading algorithms, and exploring the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies, particularly with the mysterious $XVI coin that seems to be intertwined with his identity. His exploration of self through psychedelics, his social life, and his professional aspirations are all threads in a complex tapestry, weaving together his quest for identity, purpose, and financial independence.",
