      "Story": "Xavier's journey from 18 to 22 has been a whirlwind of growth, exploration, and discovery, mirroring the rapid evolution of technology around him. Starting as a freshman at NYU, he was initially overwhelmed by the pace of city life, academic pressures, and the search for identity. However, his interest in technology, particularly in blockchain and Web3, quickly became a beacon guiding his path. His adventures with $XVI, a cryptocurrency that seemed to mirror his own life's narrative, provided both a financial and existential journey. From questioning his place in college to diving into the high-stakes world of quant trading, Xavier has shown an innate ability to ride the waves of technological and personal change. His travels, from the bustling streets of NYC to the cultural immersion in Bangkok and the serene vistas of Mount Fuji, reflect a broadening perspective, not just in technology but in life itself. His recent decision to take a leave from college to pursue opportunities in quant trading signifies a pivotal moment, embracing a life less conventional but full of potential.",
