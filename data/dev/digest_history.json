      "Story": "Xavier has transitioned into his early twenties, marked by a blend of professional growth, personal exploration, and an evolving relationship with technology. After a significant moment of reflection on his 21st birthday, Xavier took a leave of absence from NYU to pursue an opportunity in quant trading. His journey has been punctuated by social engagements, from underground poker games to international travel, which have broadened his perspective and challenged his focus. The emergence of $XVI, a cryptocurrency mysteriously linked to his initials, has added a layer of intrigue and opportunity to his life. He's now preparing to dive deeper into the crypto world, combining his love for finance and technology, while contemplating the ethical implications of AI development with his project, Xander.",
